# 🏠 House Price Data Analysis

This repository contains a beginner-friendly, end-to-end data analysis project focused on understanding what factors affect house prices. The project walks through a standard data science process using Python and common libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

The notebook follows the core data science workflow:

---

### 1. 📥 Importing Data Sets

The first step is to load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. Initial data inspection is done to understand the structure, data types, and overall shape of the dataset.

---

### 2. 🧹 Data Wrangling

Data cleaning is performed to handle:
- Missing or blank entries
- Irrelevant or duplicate columns
- Inconsistent data types

This step ensures that the dataset is ready for analysis and modeling.

---

### 3. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA helps identify patterns, trends, and relationships between variables.  
In this step:
- Visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, correlation heatmaps) are used to understand the most influential features on house price.
- Outliers and skewed distributions are also addressed.

---

### 4. 📈 Model Development

This stage focuses on building regression models to predict house prices:
- **Simple Linear Regression** using one key feature
- **Multiple Linear Regression** using several influential features
- **Ridge Regression** to reduce model complexity and avoid overfitting

---

### 5. ✅ Model Evaluation and Refinement

Model performance is evaluated using:
- **R² Score** – for explained variance  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** – for prediction error

Based on these metrics, the model is refined to improve generalization and performance.
